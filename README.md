# skin-tokens.cpp

> Fork note: Unreal Engine pipeline notes are in [docs/UE_WORKFLOW.md](docs/UE_WORKFLOW.md).

A C++23/GGML port of
[SkinTokens / TokenRig](https://github.com/VAST-AI-Research/SkinTokens) for
automatic skeleton and skin-weight generation on CPU or Vulkan.

Skin weights say how strongly every mesh vertex follows each bone. Without
them, moving a skeleton does not deform the character surface correctly.
SkinTokens takes a static mesh, predicts a suitable skeleton and its vertex
weights, and writes a portable rigged GLB. 

## Build and install on Linux

Install Git, CMake 3.25 or newer, Ninja, a C++23 compiler,
`nlohmann-json`, and Vulkan headers, loader, and shader compiler. Vulkan can be
disabled with `-DSKINTOKENS_ENABLE_VULKAN=OFF`. From a source checkout:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
cmake -S . -B build/release -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/release -j
cmake --install build/release --prefix ./dist
```

The `ggml/` submodule is pinned to an official upstream commit. During CMake
configuration, the project copies it into the build directory and applies the
ordered compatibility patches in `patches/ggml/`; the submodule checkout is
never modified. Reconfiguration reuses the prepared copy while the upstream
revision and patch hashes are unchanged. Advanced builds using a GGML tree that
already contains equivalent fixes can pass
`-DSKINTOKENS_APPLY_GGML_PATCHES=OFF`.

The install contains the shared library, C and C++ headers, CLI, GGML runtime,
and enabled dynamic backends. To test from the build tree:

```sh
ctest --test-dir build/release --output-on-failure
./build/release/bin/skintokens-cli inspect models/SkinTokens-GGUF/F16
```

Nix is optional. It supplies the build tools and Vulkan development packages,
but does not replace the normal CMake build:

```sh
nix develop
cmake --preset debug
cmake --build --preset debug -j
ctest --preset debug
```

The sanitizer build is the normal development lane:

```sh
nix develop
cmake --preset asan-ubsan
cmake --build --preset asan-ubsan -j
ctest --preset asan-ubsan
```

## Download the weights

Downloading the converted F16 GGUF bundle is the recommended setup. With the
[Hugging Face CLI](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/cli):

```sh
hf download LocalAI-io/SkinTokens-GGUF \
  --include "F16/*" \
  --local-dir models/SkinTokens-GGUF
```

Use `models/SkinTokens-GGUF/F16` as `MODEL_DIR` in the commands below. The
repository also contains an F32 bundle for numerical parity work; normal
inference should use F16.

## Rig an arbitrary mesh

The standalone path needs only a static `.glb` mesh. It generates the skeleton
and learned skin weights, then stores a one-frame rest pose in the output so it
opens as a conventional skinned glTF asset:

```sh
./build/release/bin/skintokens-cli rig \
  models/SkinTokens-GGUF/F16 \
  character.glb character-rigged.glb \
  --device vulkan
```

The model accepts arbitrary triangle meshes, although—as with any learned
rigging model—results are strongest on shapes resembling its training
distribution. `--postprocess` enables the upstream surface-locality heuristic;
omit it to preserve the raw learned weights exactly.

## Generate skin weights for an existing skeleton

Use `skin` when the armature already exists. A single rigged GLB can provide
both the geometry and static or animated skeleton; its old weights are ignored:

```sh
./build/release/bin/skintokens-cli skin \
  models/SkinTokens-GGUF/F16 \
  character-rigged.glb character-rigged.glb character-reweighted.glb \
  --device vulkan --fit none
```

Alternatively, pass separate mesh and skeleton GLBs. The default `--fit global`
uses a single uniform scale and translation to match vertical extent and centre;
it retains every relative joint position and bone-length ratio. Use `--fit none`
when both files already share coordinates.

`--fit articulated` is an explicitly experimental alternative for recognized
humanoid arm chains. A motion-only skeleton offers two length-exact poses: its
supplied rest pose, and its own first animation frame. This mode measures both
against the mesh surface along the arm bones and keeps whichever actually runs
inside the arms, so a T-pose rig driving a character generated with its arms
lowered adopts the pose the clip already provides. Doing so also makes the bind
pose and frame zero identical, so playback starts without warping the mesh. An
arm chain that still misses is then posed by analytic two-bone inverse
kinematics toward conservative mesh targets, preserving the globally scaled
upper-arm, forearm, and hand lengths exactly. That fallback's invariant follows
the template-skeleton embedding objective in Baran and Popovic's
[Pinocchio](https://www.tonychai.com/072-baran.pdf), but it is deliberately a
small pose stage rather than a copy of Pinocchio's complete LGPL rigging and
weight-generation library. A fuller distance-field embedding implementation can
replace this isolated stage later.

## Status

Safe checkpoint extraction, checked GGUF loading, CPU/Vulkan backend selection,
the complete TokenRig grammar and Qwen3 stack, Kimodo animation import, and
skinned GLB export are implemented. The F32 Qwen stack reaches `8.1e-6`
relative L2 on CPU; Vulkan reaches `7.1e-4` for the final hidden state and
`1.4e-3` for logits.

The learned binding path runs the released Michelangelo mesh encoder, Qwen
TokenRig policy, FSQ code expansion, condition encoder, and chunked SkinVAE
decoder through GGML. It samples the same 54,000 surface points as upstream
and caps dense decoder queries at 16K vertices per graph. The `skin` command
uses a supplied static or animated skeleton. The `rig` command enables
upstream's unconstrained skeleton generation, which remains experimental
because the released policy can produce unsuitable topologies. `--geometric`
is an explicit non-learned diagnostic.

Upstream's existing-skeleton interface is deliberately generic: `--use_skeleton`
retains an armature found in the input and generates skin only. It does not
promise that every arbitrary hierarchy is in-distribution or prescribe a
retargeting method. Imported GLBs are tokenized as generic articulations. The
released checkpoint stores `order_config`, while `TokenizerPart.parse` reads
`order`, so its executable imported-GLB path emits no spring/part token and
does not activate a hidden Mixamo-specific inference mode from joint names.

The full 54K-point Michelangelo encoder matches the corrected F32 PyTorch
reference at `6.5e-4` relative L2 on Vulkan. A constrained 120-step fixture
checks the production Qwen prefix and greedy policy decision at every step;
Vulkan reproduces every reference code.
The full 54K-point SkinVAE and final raw learned binding are checked
independently. CPU reaches `3.6e-6` decoder relative L2, identical top-four
bones on every vertex, and `1.4e-7` animated-vertex relative L2. The
representative Vulkan fixture reaches `9.1e-4` decoder relative L2, with
99.96% of final top-four slots shared and `5.2e-4` animated-vertex relative L2.
The optional `voxel_skin` heuristic is available with `--postprocess`, matching
the upstream demo's opt-in setting rather than being silently enabled.

Use `--device vulkan`, `--device cpu`, or `--device auto` at runtime.

Set `SKINTOKENS_PROFILE=1` to print opt-in wall-clock timings for preprocessing,
the mesh and SkinVAE encoders, TokenRig generation, binding integration, and
model loading. TokenRig's summary also reports graph count, host/device transfer
volume, transfer time, synchronized graph-compute time, and device-local KV
cache cloning:

```sh
SKINTOKENS_PROFILE=1 ./build/release/bin/skintokens-cli skin \
  models/SkinTokens-GGUF/F16 mesh.glb skeleton.glb result.glb --device vulkan
```

TokenRig keeps an F32 K/V cache on the selected backend. Surviving beams retain
their cache slots, while additional children of the same parent are cloned
device-to-device. Cache memory therefore grows with context length and the
configured beam count; lower `--beams` or `--max-tokens` when device memory is
limited.

## Convert the upstream checkpoints yourself

This is an advanced reproducibility path; most users should download the GGUF
bundle above. The two official checkpoints are MIT-labelled but use Lightning
pickle containers. Downloads are explicit, hash-checked, and excluded from
git:

```sh
./scripts/download_models.sh checkpoints
docker build -t skintokens-reference:2.7 reference
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$PWD:/work" \
  skintokens-reference:2.7 \
  --tokenrig /work/checkpoints/grpo_1400.ckpt \
  --skin-vae /work/checkpoints/last.ckpt \
  --output /work/generated/safe
python scripts/convert_to_gguf.py \
  --tokenrig generated/safe/tokenrig.safetensors \
  --skin-vae generated/safe/skin-vae.safetensors \
  --config generated/safe/config.json \
  --output models/skintokens-f32 --ftype 0
```

The normal converter accepts safetensors only. Every GGUF component records
the upstream revision and both intermediate SHA-256 identities, and model load
rejects mixed bundles.

## Optional end-to-end humanoid pipeline: Trellis2 + Kimodo

Trellis2 can generate and remesh a humanoid, Kimodo can generate its motion,
and skin-tokens.cpp can bind that motion hierarchy to the mesh. This is a
concrete full animated-asset pipeline, not a dependency or requirement of
SkinTokens:

```sh
trellis2cpp/build/examples/mesh2glb \
  trellis-mesh.t2mesh trellis-remeshed.glb 2048 \
  --print 0.5 0.0166667 --quad 20000
./build/release/bin/skintokens-cli skin \
  models/SkinTokens-GGUF/F16 \
  trellis-remeshed.glb kimodo-animation.glb character-animated.glb \
  --device vulkan
```

When the supplied skeleton is detected as SOMA30, it can optionally be
retargeted to the 52-joint order published in upstream's
`configs/skeleton/mixamo.yaml` using an explicit semantic motion map:

```sh
./build/release/bin/skintokens-cli skin \
  models/SkinTokens-GGUF/F16 \
  character.glb kimodo-soma30.glb character-mixamo.glb \
  --device vulkan --retarget-soma-to-mixamo52

./build/release/bin/skintokens-cli retarget-check kimodo-soma30.glb
```

`retarget-check` rotates each mapped source joint by +/-30 degrees around all
three axes and compares corresponding FK trajectories in normalized body
space. It also reports full-clip joint-position and foot-velocity errors. This
tests retargeting independently of learned skin weights. Retargeting is off by
default and appears in the demo only after strong SOMA30 detection.

For an unconstrained SkinTokens result, retain its mesh-fitted generated rig
and learned weights and transfer SOMA30 motion onto that hierarchy afterwards:

```sh
./build/release/bin/skintokens-cli rig \
  models/SkinTokens-GGUF/F16 character.glb character-native.glb --device vulkan
./build/release/bin/skintokens-cli retarget-generated \
  character-native.glb kimodo-soma30.glb character-animated.glb

./build/release/bin/skintokens-cli retarget-generated-check \
  kimodo-soma30.glb character-animated.glb
```

This structural recognizer maps the 22 body joints shared with SOMA30 and
tolerates different generated hand subtrees. Unmatched fingers inherit the
hand motion in a neutral local pose by default; `--map-fingers` copies SOMA's
two endpoint tracks across those branches. Low-confidence or non-humanoid
generated skeletons are rejected rather than matched by spatial proximity.
`retarget-generated-check` compares rest-relative joint displacement in body-
height units and reports the mean, maximum, worst frame, worst joint, and
per-joint maxima.

Both `.glb` and trellis2cpp's versioned `.t2mesh` are accepted by the CLI as mesh input.
Skinning should use the manifold-wrapped, quad-remeshed Trellis export, not its dense raw
marching-cubes reconstruction: the latter is millions of triangles with
generation topology that is unsuitable for animation. Direct quad remeshing is
not sufficient for raw reconstruction topology; Alpha Wrap must clean it first.
GLB scene-node transforms and vertex colours are preserved; atlas textures are
not yet round-tripped. The Kimodo rig is fitted to the mesh before
conditioning, while its animation and hierarchy are retained in the output.
SkinVAE predictions are decoded on the upstream 54K cloud and transferred to
source vertices with the same SciPy cKDTree inverse-distance 8-neighbour
interpolation, then selects and renormalizes the greatest four influences for
glTF. With `--postprocess`, the optional upstream heuristic first multiplies
those channels by its `voxel_skin` surface-geodesic matrix. The C++ diagnostic
retains Open3D voxel ordering and SciPy nearest-neighbour tie behaviour.
Generation currently recomputes the Qwen graph without a KV cache and may
take several minutes.

## C API

[`skintokens.h`](include/skintokens/skintokens.h) is a flat C11-compatible API.
It uses an opaque model handle, caller-owned fixed error buffers, explicit
defaults, and status returns; C++ exceptions never cross the ABI. Returned
backend and `last_error` strings are borrowed from the model and remain valid
until its next call or destruction.

```c
#include <skintokens/skintokens.h>

char error[512];
st_model *model = NULL;
st_runtime_options runtime = st_default_runtime_options();
runtime.device = ST_DEVICE_VULKAN;
if (st_model_load("models/SkinTokens-GGUF/F16", &runtime, &model,
                  error, sizeof(error)) != ST_OK) {
    /* report error */
}

st_generation_options generation = st_default_generation_options();
generation.surface_postprocess = 1;
int learned = 0;
st_status result = st_skin_files(model, "character.glb", "motion.glb",
                                 "animated.glb", ST_FIT_GLOBAL_SIMILARITY,
                                 &generation, &learned,
                                 error, sizeof(error));
st_model_free(model);
```

The generated-rig retarget surface uses opaque option and match handles too,
so PureGo and other FFI callers never have to predict a C structure layout:

```c
st_retarget_options *options = NULL;
st_humanoid_match *match = NULL;
st_retarget_options_create(&options, error, sizeof(error));
st_retarget_options_set_minimum_confidence(options, 0.85f,
                                           error, sizeof(error));
st_humanoid_match_glb_file("character-native.glb", options, &match,
                           error, sizeof(error));
st_retarget_soma30_glb_files("character-native.glb", "motion.glb",
                             "character-animated.glb", match, options,
                             error, sizeof(error));
st_humanoid_match_free(match);
st_retarget_options_free(options);
```

`st_rig_file` generates a skeleton and weights; `st_skin_files` generates
weights for a supplied static or animated skeleton. Pass the same GLB as both
mesh and skeleton paths for a single rigged asset. `st_inspect_glb_file`
reports mesh, skin, skeleton, animation, and recognized-rig metadata without
loading GGUF weights. The public parsing and error-buffer surface is exercised
by the ASan/UBSan libFuzzer build; GGUF loading is intentionally kept outside
that fuzzer.

## Demo

The dependency-free Go/WebGL demo is upload-first. Choose **Skeleton + skin**
for an unrigged mesh, or **Skin weights only** for either one rigged GLB or
separate mesh and skeleton GLBs. Kimodo animation GLBs work directly as the
separate skeleton input. Skeleton + skin also accepts an optional Kimodo
SOMA30 animation: the demo keeps the generated native rig, transfers the
motion onto it, and offers both files for download. Playback appears only when the supplied hierarchy is
animated. Separate inputs default to the length-preserving global fit and offer
articulated fitting as an experimental checkbox. SOMA30 retargeting appears
only when that rig is detected. The demo keeps persistent history, runs one
bounded worker, visualizes joint influences, and exports reusable GLBs. For a
generated rig driven by SOMA30, the viewer can overlay the normalized source
motion in blue, draw the retarget error vectors, and colour mapped joints by
divergence. Upload selections are retained when switching workflows: an
unrigged Skeleton + skin mesh becomes the separate character mesh in Skin
weights only, while a rigged input becomes the one-file asset. The optional
driving motion has an explicit Clear button.

```sh
cd demo
go run . \
  --listen 127.0.0.1:8095 \
  --cli ../build/release/bin/skintokens-cli \
  --model ../models/SkinTokens-GGUF/F16
```

Open `http://localhost:8095`. Paths and the listen address are flags; no local
machine paths are compiled into the C++ library or web server. Optional
giraffe-example paths default to disabled.

## Reference parity

Capture operation boundaries from the safe checkpoint in the pinned reference
image, then compare every Qwen, mesh-encoder, SkinVAE, and generation boundary.
The unconstrained fixture additionally records the skeleton/skin switch and
upstream's unusual use of model EOS as the final FSQ code:

```sh
docker build -t skintokens-reference:2.7-parity reference
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$PWD:/work" \
  --entrypoint python skintokens-reference:2.7-parity \
  /work/reference/capture_qwen_layer.py \
  --weights /work/generated/safe/tokenrig.safetensors \
  --output /work/fixtures/reference-f32 --device cpu --dtype float32

./build/release/bin/skintokens-qwen-parity \
  models/skintokens-f32 fixtures/reference-f32 cpu
./build/release/bin/skintokens-mesh-parity \
  models/skintokens-f32 fixtures/reference-f32 cpu
./build/release/bin/skintokens-vae-parity \
  models/skintokens-f32 fixtures/reference-f32 cpu
./build/release/bin/skintokens-generation-parity \
  models/skintokens-f32 fixtures/reference-f32 cpu
./build/release/bin/skintokens-qwen-batch-parity \
  models/skintokens-f32 fixtures/reference-f32 cpu
```

The batch checker compares two different token sequences evaluated together
against two serial evaluations, then repeats the comparison after a shared KV
prefill and a cloned two-child beam branch. This guards batching, cache strides,
and beam-slot cloning on both CPU and Vulkan; configure
`SKINTOKENS_QWEN_FIXTURE_DIR` to include it in the opt-in CTest model suite.

Final binding acceptance captures normalized top-four weights and reference
deformed vertices. The full checker runs the production GGML decoder and
skinning evaluator in one process:

```sh
./build/release/bin/skintokens-full-binding-parity \
  models/skintokens-f32 fixtures/animation-parity cpu
./build/release/bin/skintokens-full-binding-parity \
  models/skintokens-f32 fixtures/animation-parity vulkan
```

For the strict Vulkan diagnostic, disable reduced-precision matrix paths:

```sh
GGML_VK_DISABLE_F16=1 GGML_VK_DISABLE_COOPMAT=1 \
GGML_VK_DISABLE_COOPMAT2=1 GGML_VK_DISABLE_GRAPH_OPTIMIZE=1 \
  ./build/release/bin/skintokens-qwen-parity \
  models/skintokens-f32 fixtures/reference-f32 vulkan
```

## Upstream scope and licence

SkinTokens is a learned skin-weight representation. TokenRig is the complete
mesh-to-rig system: a Michelangelo point encoder, Qwen3-0.6B causal model, and
conditional FSQ-VAE decoder. This use is therefore within its intended scope,
not an attempt to treat SkinTokens as a motion generator.

The upstream repository and Hugging Face model card identify code and weights
as MIT. This project is Apache-2.0 and keeps upstream attribution in `NOTICE`.
